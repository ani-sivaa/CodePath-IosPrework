### App Idea: **Pomodoro Timer with a Pet (Tomogatchi-style)**
I want to create a Pomodoro timer app inspired by Forest but with a twist: it combines productivity with the fun of taking care of a virtual pet. The idea is that as users complete Pomodoro sessions, their virtual pet grows and thrives. The pet’s health and happiness depend on how consistently the user follows the Pomodoro technique. Features I’d like to implement include:
- **Pet Growth System**: The pet evolves as users complete work sessions, requiring them to focus during Pomodoro intervals to help it grow.
- **Rewards for Focus**: Completing Pomodoro sessions earns rewards (food, toys, accessories) for the pet, encouraging users to stay focused.
- **Social Sharing**: Users can share their pet’s progress or achievements with friends or a community, building a sense of accomplishment and accountability.

This app would aim to make working more engaging by tying in the motivation of caring for a virtual pet while staying productive.
